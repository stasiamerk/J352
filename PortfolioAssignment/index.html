I am a journalism student at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism with a passion for covering underreported voices. I got my Associate Degree in Communication Studies from Montgomery College, after which I transferred to the University of Maryland. I have worked on the Gaithersburg beat for a news writing and reporting course, written stories concerning international and graduate students at my university and managed the social media for a university newspaper. I am excited to see where my devotion for writing takes me next!
