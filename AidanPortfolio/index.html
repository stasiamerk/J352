 <p class="bio"> I am a c/o '27 Journalism student at The University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism, with an interest in sports writing and reporting. During my freshman year at UMD, I was afforded a plethora of opportunities such as beat-writing for Maryland women's basketball, writing for Maryland Baseball Network, and producing videos for Terrapin Sports Central. Throughout my sophomore year, I've continued working for WMUC, MBN, and TSC, while also covering Maryland field hockey for The Diamondback!</p>
