<div> <p> The <a href="https://merrill.umd.edu/" target="_blank">Philip Merrill College of Journalism</a> at the University of Maryland has seen an increase in off-campus transfer students since they took off the Limited Enrollment Program title in 2021, but there are many steps remaining to make the transfer students feel well-prepared and welcomed.</p> </div>

<p>Because journalism used to be a limited enrollment program at UMD, all first-year students were not officially journalism majors until they passed Journalism 101, 200 and 201, according to Dean Rafael Lorente. This was especially discouraging for off-campus transfer students as they wouldn’t become a part of the journalism program until around senior year.</p>

<p> <div class="stat"> The average of off-campus journalism transfer students went from 1.75 in 2016-2019, to 14.5 in 2021-2024.</div> </p>

<p>Lorente said that ending the Limited Enrollment Program Status ensured that all first-year students are automatically journalism majors, but he would like to find ways to better support transfer students. One way could be to fund Master’s degree scholarships for transfer students so that they can make up for their shortened time here as undergraduate students. </p>

	<p> Josh Madden, the assistant dean for undergraduate studies at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism said that the school has formed a committee to review syllabi of journalism courses at institutions. If a journalism course syllabus matches enough with that of this school, the course can be counted for credit and give students a head start on beginner requisites such as JOUR 200 and 201. </p>

	<p> 
Madden said the school has worked with the following institutions on transfer credits and course evaluations: </p>

	<p>The syllabi of many of these schools’ journalism courses are still not satisfactory to transfer, but working on these evaluations is a continual effort. </p>

<p>Stella Garner, a journalism major who transferred from Prince George’s Community College said she got her associate degree in public relations and journalism, but none of the journalism credits transferred to this school. She added that she has a lot of friends from community college who went to other universities in the state because their credits were accepted there. </p>

<p>Garner is doing 2  1/2 years at UMD. She said having the ability to take JOUR 200 and 201 at the same time, which is open to transfer students, was helpful because otherwise she would possibly have to stay for 3 full years. </p>

<p>Ashley Neyra, a transfer student from Montgomery College, said her first semester at UMD was “very challenging,” as she had to figure out everything on her own. </p>

<p>“I just feel like I was thrown into the pool with no floaties,” Neyra said. </p>

<p>Neyra, who has to do 2  1/2 years at UMD,  said that she is bored in some of her classes such as photojournalism, because she learned all of the content at Montgomery College from which her credits did not transfer. </p>

<p>Neyra said that it would have been helpful for the journalism school to reach out to her and guide her while she was still at Montgomery College. </p>
